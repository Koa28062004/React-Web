# Project Structure
Our project consists of 2 main folders: API and GUI, where API is the folder for the backend code and API serves the Frontend. We use ReactJS (frontend) and ExpressJS (backend).

Here is a more detailed analysis of your project structure:

**"API" Folder:**

* Used for developing the backend of the application that uses ExpressJS.
* **data.txt** used for storing data.
* **index.js** is the primary function in API to code the search input.

**"GUI" Folder:**

* Where the front end of the application is developed using ReactJS.
* Can be organized into subfolders similar to the "API" folder to manage different parts of the user interface.
* Each subfolder in "GUI" contains React source code, UI components, CSS files, images, and files related to the application's user interface.
